# Pretty Static Blog

Blog written using Jekyll, and styled using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)

CSS uses Tailwind, and the command to process it is:

    npx tailwindcss build tailwind/source.css -o assets/css/main.css

This is mainly the styling for the Markdown CSS... most other elements are styled using utility classes in HTML.
