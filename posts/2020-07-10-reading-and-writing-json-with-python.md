The beauty of this is that both Netlify and IFTTT are free to start with and their free tiers are very generous. If you start to build lots of sites very regularly then you might start running up a bill on both services, but in this case for a blog or two to be updated once or twice a day, you are probably going to be fine.

You used to have to set up a server for this, and there are still many advantages of having a server to do some of this stuff, but if you don't want to start getting waist deep in Linux then this combination will get you very far. 

This is just one use of both these services. There are so many more to explore so it's worth checking them out in more detail to see what other automation you can employ.
