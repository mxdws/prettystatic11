## [Pretty Static](https://prettystatic.com) is a blog about making websites.

I know that sounds pretty general, so to add a bit more detail, I have been interested in Static Site Generators since I discovered Jekyll back in the year 2013. Since then, the world of web development has gone static-crazy, and I thought it might be the right time to chip in with my experiences.

The reason it is *Pretty* Static is because I am not entirely single minded in my advocacy for a website built from static HTML pages. For context, I am not a web developer, or indeed any kind of developer, and I want to learn all kinds of things. I believe that whilst static sites make things conveneient, it is good to get your hands dirty in the more complex stuff, and I will be looking to explore some of the not-so-static in this blog. Static can be the final leg of an extremely dynamic journey.

Enjoy!
